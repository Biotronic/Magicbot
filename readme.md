# Magicbot

## What's this?

Magicbot is a simple slack bot that answer to `/mtg <card name>` requests.

## How's it work?

It uses slack's slash command system, and is simply a php script that takes a few POST parameters and echoes a JSON string if it finds any matching cards.

## What more do I need to know?

I've no idea.
